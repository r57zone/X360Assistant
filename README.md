The volume is changed by pressing `Xbox + X`, `Xbox + B` or `Xbox + DPAD ←`, `Xbox + DPAD →` simultaneously. If the keys are actively used in the game, change the volume in the game menu.



A screenshot is created by simultaneously pressing one of the combinations: `Xbox + A`, `Xbox + DPAD ↑`, `Xbox + DPAD ↓`, `Xbox + LB`, `Xbox + RB` (choose one that doesn't interfere with play). Screenshot can be created in several modes: Game Bar (standard), Steam (pressing F12), Game Bar and Steam (simultaneously).
