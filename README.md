# Features
To use the utility, go to settings → Xbox Game Bar and uncheck the "Open Xbox Game Bar by pressing the Xbox button" option. Game Bar will still open the utility, but in a slightly different way. You can exit the Game Bar by pressing the `B` button.

The volume is changed by pressing `Xbox + X`, `Xbox + B` or `Xbox + DPAD ←`, `Xbox + DPAD →` simultaneously. If the keys are actively used in the game, change the volume in the game menu.



A screenshot is created by simultaneously pressing one of the combinations: `Xbox + A`, `Xbox + DPAD ↑`, `Xbox + DPAD ↓`, `Xbox + LB`, `Xbox + RB` (choose one that doesn't interfere with play). Screenshot can be created in several modes: Game Bar (standard), Steam (pressing F12), Game Bar and Steam (simultaneously).
